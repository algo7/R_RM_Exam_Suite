2. TopicIII:Linear Programming is not done, due to the fact that excel solvers are not allowed. Questions will be given in a simpler form that can be solved without using the excel solver. Use TopicIII:LP_Exam instead in case if basic linear programming questions are asked.
3. TopicIV:EMRR is not done. Due to the save problem as above. Use TopicIV:EMRR (Exam | Must be optimized first) instead. Remember to include the rates and optimized Nested.Protection.Level,EMRR.superior,EMRR.inferior,Diff, and Rounded.NPL in the csv file.
